# Automatic Slideshow
  
A minimalist slideshow app for Android, built with Flutter. Allows selecting a folder of images (searches subfolders too), setting a time interval between image switching in seconds and viewing the images in best-fit mode. The swipe feature was removed due to Flutter being unable to cancel `Future.delay`.
  
# Download
You can download the APK from the `Download` folder in this repository. It's built to be compatible with Android version 7 onward.
